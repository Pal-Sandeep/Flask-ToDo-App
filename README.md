# Flask CRUD App README

This README provides an overview of the Flask CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application. This application allows users to perform basic CRUD operations on a database using a Flask web server.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Pal-Sandeep/Flask-ToDo-App.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Change your current directory to the cloned project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Flask-ToDo-App
   ```

3. **Create a Virtual Environment**: It's recommended to use a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies. You can create a virtual environment using `virtualenv` or `venv`:

   ```bash
   virtualenv venv
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   ```

4. **Activate the Virtual Environment**: Activate the virtual environment:

   On macOS/Linux:
   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

   On Windows:
   ```bash
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

5. **Install Dependencies**: Install the project dependencies using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

6. **Set Up the Database**: Configure the database settings in `config.py` and run migrations to set up the database schema:

   ```bash
   flask db init
   flask db migrate -m "Initial migration"
   flask db upgrade
   ```

7. **Run the Application**: Start the Flask development server:

   ```bash
   flask run
   ```

   The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:5000` by default.

## Usage

The Flask CRUD application provides the following functionality:

- **Create**: Users can add new records to the database using a web form.
- **Read**: Users can view existing records in the database.
- **Update**: Users can edit and update existing records.
- **Delete**: Users can delete records from the database.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- **app/**
  - Contains the main application code.
  - **templates/**: HTML templates for rendering web pages.
  - **static/**: Static files such as CSS stylesheets, JavaScript files, and images.
  - **models.py**: Defines database models using SQLAlchemy.
  - **routes.py**: Defines application routes and request handling logic.
- **migrations/**: Contains database migration scripts generated by Flask-Migrate.
- **config.py**: Configuration settings for the Flask application.
- **requirements.txt**: List of project dependencies.

## Dependencies

The Flask CRUD application uses the following main dependencies:

- Flask: Web framework for building web applications in Python.
- SQLAlchemy: SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library.
- Flask-Migrate: Extension for handling database migrations with Flask.
